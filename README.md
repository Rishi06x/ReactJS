# ReactJS — My Learning Journey

This repository is where I upload whatever I learn in React, day by day.  
Nothing fancy — just my notes, small experiments, and things I want to remember.

## Why this repo exists

I wanted a simple place to track my progress while learning React.  
Every time I learn something new, I push it here so I can look back and see how far I’ve come.

## What I’m learning (gradually)

- Components  
- Props and state  
- Hooks  
- Routing  
- API calls  
- Small projects to practice  

I’m not rushing — just learning at my own pace.
